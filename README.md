# Computer Literacy for FN Students Using The Raspberry Pi

This repository contains the web-site for the FNTP CS Raspberry Pi
Project.  In it you will find the source and media for the site, the
tools used to create and update the blog, and much of the raw course
material.

Since the project is not part of charitable organization, academic
research project, or any traditional not-for-profit venture, providing
a publicly accessible source of progress seems appropriate:

Thus, the purpose of this repository--and the sites it generates--is
to help provide as much transparency as possible with respect to
financial matters, generated results, and the overall project's
progress to those that have helped make the project possible.

Over the next weeks, months, and possibly years, the material
contained in this repository will be polished, extended and
continuously published to the following web-site:

For further details on the project, its philosophy, kind contributors,
etc., please refer to the above site.
