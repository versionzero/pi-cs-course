<h2>Introduction<h2>

<h2>Computer Resiliency<h2>

This is a new term to me.  In fact, I was only just became aware of
its use in July of this year (2013).



There is a great deal of talk about <i>Computer Literacy</i>, what it
means, when is it achieved, how we should teach it, etc. I doubt that
I am, or ever will be in a position to answer or even asses proposals
on these questions. I say this not because I do not consider myself
qualified. I do believe I am, and I think I could argue for that
assertion if it were necessary-- but I will not do that here. Instead,
I would like to use the term Computer Resiliency to describe what is,
or should be, taught in introductory Computer Science courses.

The term, Computer Resiliency--much like Computer Literacy produces
literate computer learners--transforms learners in to resilient
computer users, i.e. those types of users that posses sufficient
knowledge to perform novel computer based tasks with by exploiting
what they already know.

Computer Literacy, it seems, is a term that is ill-equipped or overused
and overloaded


<h2>Inverting the subject</h2>

This document outlines a proposed change to the Computer Science 0500
course, offered in the First Nations Transition Program (FNTP) in the
Department of Native American Studies.

I propose to invert the class: that is, to make the topic of the class
the use of computers and Computer Science as tools rather than
focusing on them as a topic themselves. To achieve this, the course
will focus on storytelling, and how a story might be represented
digitally.  This may take the form of writing, pictures, sound, levels
of interactivity as well as various other forms of available
multimedia.  Storytelling is of particular relevance to First Nations
(FN), in part due to traditional oral stories, and it is broad enough
an area to integrate many types of tools whose functions will
translate to other uses in other areas.


<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

Better late than never. Right?

The idea for the changes proposed by this project stem from a number
of sources.  I attribute much of the impetus to pursue these changes
based on personal frustration; however, I'd be remis to exclude those
to whom I am indebted for their opinions on, and practices in
Education that have shaped my own views.
