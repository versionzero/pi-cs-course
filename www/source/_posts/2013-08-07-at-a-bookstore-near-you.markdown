"[Good news everyone!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D1cap6yETA)" ~
Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, 31st Century.

We have further funding!

<!--more-->

It seems that after months of waiting, the [University of
Lethbridge][1] and the [Faculty of Arts and Science][2] through
[University Advancement][3] have found a modest source of funding to
further help make this project a reality.  A special thanks to
[Dr. Muriel Mellow](http://directory.uleth.ca/users/muriel.mellow) for
getting it all organized and approved.

I'm not sure if it was happenstance or a lightly forced hand, but the
week I put this website up was the same week all the funding was
approved. I shall err on the side of the former and, at worst,
consider the website's publication as a means of gentle reminder.

This means there are a number of changes:

First, it means the finances committed here are no longer necessary to
purchase the machines.  This can be dealt with in a number of ways,
but mostly simply: I can refund your commitment, or I can put the
balance towards additional in-class projects, such as some
[additional components](http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm), [Lego
enhancements](http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/), along with a
number of other worthwhile class projects.

Second, and most important to the class, the students will be able to
have access to the equipment on or before the first day of class.  The
[University of Lethbridge Bookstore](http://www.uleth.ca/bookstore/)
will carry the machines as a kit, including all the required cables,
adapters, etc. as well as provide support for the materials contained
therein.

Using the Bookstore has a particularly unique benefit for FNTP
students, as they can acquire material from the Bookstore while their
funding paperwork is being processed.  This means that&mdash;unlike
previous semesters&mdash;students will have all their materials at the
start of the school year, rather than being subject to individual
financial circumstances.  Simply put: they will have the *built*
computers on the first day of class.

To me, this does not change the intent of project, it just widens its
possible scope.  While the initial idea was to provide a portable
machine to each student as a first phase. It was always my hope and
intention to increase in quantity and and diversity the set of
exercises offered in the course.  The new source of funding will help
accelerate developments to the course.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know, using the
space provided bellow&mdash;or via email, if you prefer.

Best,<br />
